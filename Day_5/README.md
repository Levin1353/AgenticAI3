Overview

This application is an AI-powered quiz generator built with Langflow.
It takes a given context (for example, a lecture transcript, text passage, or knowledge document) and automatically generates 10 multiple-choice questions (MCQs).

Each question includes four options, and after presenting all 10 questions, the AI provides the correct answers with detailed explanations to help learners understand why the chosen option is correct.
